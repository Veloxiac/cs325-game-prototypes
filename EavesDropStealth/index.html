<h2>EavesDrop</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Try to avoid the detection of the other while eavesdropping on their conversations.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Eavesdropping
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: mouse, randomness: deterministic, Play Styles: Achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I would like the player to try to feel like they are spying on those around them and have to tread carefully so they are not discovered. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game plays by moving the mouse around the screen, and the player character will follow. You are supposed to keep the player on the outside of as many enemies area as you can while not getting too close to the enemy. The detection meter will rapidly go up whenever you are being detected, while the score will go up for each enemy's area that you are in.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The evaluation was on stealth based proximity.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game contains a (albeit very simple) stealth mechanic that should separate it from many others. The detection speed is quite fast and should increase the challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting/premise is not very important to this game, but it is set in the future, where a robot walking next to another robot (that I can only assume is talking to other robots remotely) constitutes eavesdropping. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You play a nosy robot that is trying to hear as much about the people around him as possible as long as he isn't caught.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone with a couple minutes to waste. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
A few minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will have to manage their "Vinn diagram" of circles while not getting too close to any of the enemies in order to maximize their score.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Android Logo: <a href="http://www.free-icons-download.net/images/android-logo-icon-64976.png">Android Logo</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
While I'm sure there are other games similar to this one, I can't think of any that I referenced directly. This game will most closely resemble any stealth game, especially the early ones where AI is incredibly basic.
