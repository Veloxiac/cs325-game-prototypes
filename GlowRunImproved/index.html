<h2>Glow Run</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Use your glow to see obstacles before they hit you and avoid them.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Person who glows in the dark
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: keyboard, randomness: random, Play Styles: Achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The game should make the player feel like they have to look carefully for danger, as their glow is only a few feet ahead of them. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game controls like an endless runner. For now all you do is press space to jump over obstacles that get in your way. More will be added later, but the glow makes this a bit more interesting as it decreases the amount of time you have to react.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I am evaluating the concept of having limited vision in an endless runner due to a dark aesthetic.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game features a light and dark mechanic, where things could possibly be happening in the darkness, but you are only made aware once the objects are close to you.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is not very important. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There isn't much story involved. You attempt to run for as long as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone with a couple minutes to waste. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 minute per round.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
In future iterations, I may add glowing objects to the scene that change up how the game will work. Once that is added, The player will have to discern what is happening in the scene based only off of what they can see.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is the last of an iteration sequence, and was an iteration of <a href="GlowRun">Analog Revision: Glow Run</a>. For this revision, I reworked jumping and added a dash mechanic. You now jump higher based off of how long you press the jump key. The dash ability also allows you to correct for some mistakes in jumping, by moving you forward at your current height. I also fixed some bugs causing the player to jitter. The obstacles now also spawn in a better pattern, this should provide more of a challenge, and prevent the game from feeling like you are only ever jumping over ankle-height obstacles.
