<h2>Crash</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Hit as many of the obstacles as you can to avoid hitting the end of the course.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Car Accident
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: keyboard, randomness: deterministic, Play Styles: Achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
This game should evoke a sense of speed initially. They are trying to stop their car as quickly as possible and therefore should feel like their car is out of control. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game controls with the left and right arrow keys. you simply have to hit as many obstacles as you can before you hit the object at the end, but you cant slow your car down.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I am evaluating the concept of hitting obstacles, rather than avoiding them, to slow yourself down.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game contains a somewhat "backwards" structure, where the speed is frontloaded, and the you have to plan ahead in order to stop your vehicle.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is not very important, other than the fact that you are a car trying to stop yourself from hitting the end of the track. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You play as the driver of a vehicle whos brakes just went out. You have to crash into as many objects as you can in order to save the people at the end of the track.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone with a couple minutes to waste. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
30 seconds per round.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players have to attempt to hit all of the obstacles that pass by. In future levels, this may mean choosing a specific path on a map. For now means directing your car in that direction as quickly as possible, but trying not to overshoot.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game was a revision of an analog game called Crash. This revision takes the turn based nature of the analog game and turns it into a more face paced action game. The game has far more to do with reaction time than the analog version, but hopefully some of the decision making still transfers into the digital version. The digital version is better at getting across a sense of speed.
