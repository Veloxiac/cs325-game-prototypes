<h2>Asteroid Dodge</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A game where you attempt to dodge the Asteroids for as long as you can as they continue to speed up.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Asteroids
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input involves moving left and right. The asteroids are all placed randomly and fall at semi random speeds. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should feel challenged to get to a new time every time they play the game, with the challenge increasing the further they go.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can move left and right while trying to dodge as many asteroids that have semi- random speeds and positions as the player is building up speed. In its current state, there isn't a lot else to it, but the gameplay could be expanded to include powerups, enemies, and more varied styles of gameplay. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The prototype was designed to test the action of dodging asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Since this is the first phaser game that I have created, I wasn't able to go into a lot of unique territories with my game design.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game has no story or setting to speak of, but is set in outer space, where your ship is frantically trying to dodge asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game has no relevant story, and revolves entirely around dodging asteroids that come towards you.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game is simple enough for anyone to play, so any demographic could get into it. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It takes about 1-4 minutes to play a game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
This is not a very strategic game, but the primary strategy revolves around dodging asteroids.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spaceship: <a href="http://www.pngmart.com/image/26266">Spaceship</a></li>
<li>Asteroid: <a href="http://pics-about-space.com/asteroid-clipart-png?p=1">Asteroid</a></li> 
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game resembles quite a few games which revolve around the player being located at the bottom of the screen and dodging that which comes at them.
